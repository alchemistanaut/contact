\section{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item iOS device (e.g. iPhone or iPad) no older than iOS 6.0.
\item A desktop browser is only needed initially to create SSL keys,
  and only if you are going to use a Certificate Authority (``CA'').
  The browser will not be used thereafter.  Any of these browsers will
  work:
  
    \begin{tabular}{lp{50mm}>{\small}p{0.37\textwidth}}
    \textsl{\textbf{Browser}}          & \textsl{\textbf{Key storage consistent w/Apple Mail on OS/X}} & \textsl{\textbf{Notes}}\\
    Chrome/Chromium \tiny(OS/X)        & \yesgood                & Some versions of Chrome may have problems with key generation.\\
    \hline
    Chrome/Chromium \tiny(Windows)     & not applicable          & \\
    \hline
    Firefox \tiny(all platforms)       & \nobad\ \keystoreintl   & \\
    \hline
    \st{Internet Explorer \tiny(OS/X)} & --                      & Don't use IE on Mac; latest version (4.0) is discontinued.\\
    \hline
    Internet Explorer \tiny(Windows)   & not applicable          & \\
    \hline
    Safari \tiny(OS/X)                 & \yesgood                & Some versions of Safari may have problems with key generation.\\
    \hline
    Safari \tiny(Windows)              & not applicable          & \\
  \end{tabular}

  If you have a Mac and intend Apple Mail to also handle encrypted
  messages, browsers above that are indicated ``\yesgood'' for sharing
  the same key storage as Apple Mail are more convenient.  If you only
  need to setup an iOS device then it doesn't matter what browser you
  use.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transferring your certificate from the browser to Mail.app}\label{cert_install}
If you generated your key pair manually, skip to \fullref{import}.
Otherwise, follow the steps below to first export your key from your
browser.
\subsubsection{(Safari only) Export your key from keychain access}
Safari stores your key on your keychain instead of keeping it internal
to the browser.  To export it:

% Double-click on Keychain to open it. On the left, click on
% ``Certificates''.  Highlight the certificate to export and open File
% $\gg$ Export. Choose an
% appropriate filename (e.g. \texttt{mycert.pfx}) and directory.

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}% This minipage inhibits page splitting
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Open \emph{Finder} and go to Applications $\triangleright$
      Utilities $\triangleright$ Keychain Access.
    \item Select the ``login'' keychain from the Keychains list on the
      upper left side of the Keychain Access window.
    \item Select ``My Certificates'' in the Category list on the lower
      left side of the window.
    \item On the right side of the window, a list of certificates will
      appear. Find the one that’s associated with your e-mail
      account. If there is more than one, check the expiration date
      column and select the one with the most recent date. However, do
      not select one that has a red X on its icon; such certificates
      are invalid.
    \item From the File menu choose ``Export~Items...''.
    \item Select the ``Personal Information Exchange (\texttt{.p12})''
      file format. Give the file a suitable name, and save it
      someplace safe. I suggest that you do not save it to cloud
      storage (iCloud, Dropbox, etc.)
    \item You'll be prompted to create a strong passphrase for the
      file. This will be used to secure your certificate while you
      move it. It's important that you choose a very strong
      passphrase. I recommend using a password that's at least 20
      random characters long, or a phrase made up of six or more
      random words.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{multicols}
\end{minipage}\\[1em]

Continue on to \fullref{import}.

\subsubsection{(Chrome only) Export your key from your browser}
Follow \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3rOEpGjrc\&start=310}{%
  YouTube video n3rOEpGjrc} (the link of which jumps you to the
relevant point in the video), or follow these steps:

\newcommand{\pwadvice}{%
  You will be prompted for a password for the backup file.  A strong
  password is important because the next step will expose the file to
  entities who could attack it.  Since this password is temporary
  (will only need to be typed on one occasion), a strong password will
  not be a burden.}
  
\input{src/key_export_chrome.tex}

Continue on to \fullref{import}.

\subsubsection{(Firefox only) Export your key from your browser}

\input{src/key_export_firefox.tex}

Continue on to \fullref{import}.

\subsubsection{Export your key from browsers other than Chrome or Firefox}
\shrug\ Try to mirror the approaches above in your browser.

\subsubsection{Importing your key}\label{import}

\begin{enumerate}%\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\item Find the \texttt{.p12} file you either created manually or
  exported from a browser in previous steps.  E-mail it to yourself.
\end{enumerate}

Either follow the illustrated steps under ``Importing your certificate
into iPhone/iPad'' in
\url{https://www.comodo.com/pdf/Comodo-CPAC-iPhone-iPad.pdf},
% alternatively, and more comprehensive => http://ccit.mines.edu/UserFiles/File/ccit/security/importing_and_using_smime_certificate-web.pdf
\textbf{OR} continue with the following steps:\\
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}% This minipage inhibits page splitting
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}
    \item (on your iOS device, in mail.app) open the above-composed e-mail.
      Do this on all your iOS devices.
    \item Open the file attachment by tapping it.
    \item Tap ``\verb|install|'' at the top right.
    \item Ignore the unsigned profile warning, and tap ``\verb|install|''
      two more times (or as needed).
    \item At the password prompt, enter the \emph{backup} password created
      in step \ref{makebupw}.
    \item Tap ``\verb|Next|'' at the top right.
    \item Tap ``\verb|Done|'' at the top right.
    \item (optional) The key backup file and e-mail carrying it
      may be deleted and the password may be forgotten at this point.
      There is no further use for them.  The backup file can always be
      re-created from Firefox if the key must be imported to other
      iOS devices later.
      % http://www.macwhiz.com/blog/2014/11/18/apple-s-mime/
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{multicols}
\end{minipage}\\[1em]

The new certificate will expire (see ``validity'' in section~\ref{catable}).

\subsection{Enabling S/MIME functionality in mail.app}\label{smime_enable}
Either follow the illustrated steps under ``Enable S/MIME for your
mail account'' and ``Enable signing and encryption'' in
\url{https://www.comodo.com/pdf/Comodo-CPAC-iPhone-iPad.pdf}, or
continue with the following steps:\\[-2em]%
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.2\textwidth}%
  \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{images/mailapp_smime_settings_indicated.png}
\end{wrapfigure}%
\begin{enumerate}%\setcounter{enumi}{14}
\item (iOS device) go to: Settings $\triangleright$ Mail, Contacts,
  Calendars $\triangleright$ Accounts: (e-mail service provider for
  the address you created a key for) $\triangleright$ IMAP:
  Account... $\triangleright$ Advanced $\triangleright$ S/MIME.
\item enable it
\item go to: ``\verb|Sign|'' and enable it.  There will be an address under
  ``Certificates'' if the certificate installation worked earlier.
\item repeat the above step for ``\verb|Encrypt|''
\item go back: \textbf{Account} $\ll$ Advanced
\item tap ``\verb|Done|'' in the top right corner.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Distribute your S/MIME certificate (aka public key)}
In short: simply send an e-mail to the recipient using mail.app.  If
you created your own CA and key pair manually instead of using your
browser to subscribe to a CA, then you must also send the
\verb|ca.crt| file
that you created.\\

Detailed explanation: You have a pair of keys (these were created in
section~\ref{catable}).  One is a public key and the other is a
private key.  The public key must be sent to those who will send you
encrypted e-mail.  They will use your public key to encrypt messages
to you.  Your public key is automatically contained in the signature
of all messages you send using mail.app (because you enabled S/MIME
signing in section~\ref{smime_enable}).

So to distribute your public key, simply send the other party an
e-mail from mail.app, which need not be encrypted.  They can then
extract your public key from your signature (which is composed as an
attached file named ``\verb|smime.p7s|'').

\section{Prep to send encrypted mail% or verify signatures on received mail
}
Before you can send someone an encrypted message, you need their
S/MIME certificate (public key).  Follow section~\ref{smime_enable} if
you haven't already done so, but instead of configuring the e-mail
service provider for your own key, choose the e-mail service provider
you will send the encrypted messages from (if different).  Then follow
the next section (\ref{import_cert}):

\subsection{Importing the S/MIME certificate of another
  party}\label{import_cert}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Ask the other party to send you a signed message.
    \item %\raisebox{0.6\baselineskip}{\parbox[t]{0.9\textwidth}{%
          Open the signed message in mail.app.  Successfully signed
          messages have a blue ten-point star with a check in the center,
          which appears to the right of the senders
          address. E.g. \raisebox{-0.8\baselineskip}{%
            \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{%
              images/mailapp_smime_signed_checkmark.png}}
          
    \item Tap the \emph{From} address.
    \item Tap ``\verb|View Certificate|''.
    \item Tap the ``\verb|Install|'' button.
    \item Tap ``\verb|Done|'' on the top right corner.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{multicols}
\end{minipage}\\[1em]

Now you can send encrypted messages to the sender.
