\section{Prerequisites}\label{prereq}
\begin{itemize}
\item MS Outlook 2013 or later is recommended.  Earlier versions also
  officially support S/MIME but users often report difficulties,
  particularly with Outlook 2010.
\item A browser is only needed initially to create SSL keys, and only
  if you are going to use a Certificate Authority (``CA'').  The
  browser will not be used thereafter.  Any of these browsers will
  work:

  % Would be nice to use \rowcolors in the following table, but text
  % gets clobbered in the \multirow cell, and
  % \hiderowcolors is broken entirely.

  \end{tabular}

  Browsers above that are indicated ``\yesgood'' for sharing the same
  key storage as Outlook are more convenient for this setup because
  keys need not be copied, thus section~\ref{cert_install} may be
  skipped.
\end{itemize}

\section{Prep to receive encrypted mail or to send signed mail}
% \subsection{YouTube video (alternative to this document)}
% For Outlook 2013 and 2016 users there is a comprehensive YouTube video
% demonstrating whole process using Comodo for the certificate
% authority.  It starts with nine minutes of blather, but {\large
%   \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfancZGEGjg\&start=535}{this
%     link}} skips straight to the relevant part.  That video is
% detailed enough to replace this entire document.

\input{src/get_smime_cert.tex}

\subsection{Installing your certificate into Outlook}\label{cert_install}
If you created your key using a browser that uses the same key storage
as Outlook (as indicated in \fullref{prereq}), skip to
\fullref{outlookcfg}.  If you generated your key pair manually, skip
to \fullref{import}.

\subsubsection{(Chrome only) Export your key from your browser}
There are multiple browsers which do not share the same key storage as
Outlook, but this section presumes you are using Chrome.  Follow
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3rOEpGjrc\&start=310}{YouTube
  video n3rOEpGjrc} (the link of which jumps you to the relevant point
in the video), or follow these steps:\\[1em]

\newcommand{\pwadvice}{%
  You will be prompted for a password for the backup file.  A weak
  password is fine, because this backup file will not be transmitted
  or retained.  You will import it into Outlook locally, and then you
  will delete the backup file.}

\input{src/key_export_chrome.tex}

\vspace{1em}
Then skip to section~\ref{import} for steps to import the key into
Outlook.

\subsubsection{(Firefox only) Export your key from your browser}
There are multiple browsers which do not share the same key storage as
Outlook, but this section presumes you are using Firefox.  Watch
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGHaB0elkaA\&start=226}{YouTube
  video wGHaB0elkaA} or follow the steps below to export the key from
the Firefox and then import it into Outlook.

The video demonstrates using Outlook 2010 for the mail client and
Firefox (a pre-2012 version) for the browser.  The first few minutes
start by walking through key creation on Symantec's website, which is
useless because Symantec no longer offers the service.  So the YouTube
link skips that portion of the video automatically.
% Note that the speaker elects to use the (now obsolete) hash
% algorithm SHA-1.  Ignore that advice and just go with the default.

If not following the above-mentioned video, these are the steps to
export from a more recent version of Firefox:

\input{src/key_export_firefox.tex}

\subsubsection{Import your key into Outlook}\label{import}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.35\textwidth}
  \centerline{\textsl{(on OS/X)}} If you created your own CA and
  personal key pairs manually using openssl, then first follow
  \href{https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/managing-ssl-certificate-authorities-on-os-x/}{%
    this guide} to import your own CA certificate.\\[0.5em]

  Simply double-click the \texttt{.p12} backup file that was produced
  in the previous section.  OS/X will then import your personal key
  into the ``Keychain Access'' tool.  According to
  \href{https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984223(v=office.16).aspx}{MS
    docs} Outlook 2016 uses Keychain Access.

  Older versions of Outlook may require more steps.  Outlook 2011
  users should read
  \href{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2957671/you-cannot-manage-your-certificates-in-the-mac-os-x-10-9-keychain}{%
    this doc}.

    chosen in final step of the previous.
  \item Click ``\texttt{OK}'' in the pop-up dialog and the next
    window.
    % these are actually the config steps -- probably should be in the next section!
    % \item Go to Email Security (left pane) $\gg$ Settings.. (button)
    % \item Choose an arbitrary name for the field \texttt{Security Settings Name} (e.g. ``Comodo'')
    % \item Tick the box for ``\texttt{Default Security Settings for this cryptographic message format}''
    % \item Click ``\texttt{Choose..}'' to the right of ``\texttt{Signing Certificate}''
    % \item You'll likely only have one key, and it will be selected automatically.  Otherwise select the most recent key, and click ``\texttt{OK}''
  \item After the key is imported into Outlook, you should delete the
    backup file.  (You can always create a new backup file from
    Firefox if needed).
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Configuring Outlook}\label{outlookcfg}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
  \centerline{\textsl{(on OS/X)}}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item On the Tools menu, click Accounts.
  \item Click the account that you want to send a digitally signed message from, click Advanced, and then click the Security tab.
  \item Under Digital signing, on the Certificate pop-up menu, click the certificate that you want to use.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}\hfill%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
  \centerline{\textsl{(on Windows)}}\vspace{0.5em}Follow
  \href{https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2014/04/11/email-encryption-outlook/#setup-email-certificate}{this
    document}.  That link skips the top portion and takes you straight
  to ``How to set up your e-mail certificate in Outlook'' because you
  already have a ``digital ID''.  That will configure Outlook for
  using your certificate.
\end{minipage}

% That process assumes Outlook already has your key automatically, and
% thus no export/import are needed.  If there are no issues with the key
% assignment step (that is, you were able to find your Comodo key), then
% you can skip to section~\ref{distribution}.

\subsection{Distribute your S/MIME certificate (aka public key)}\label{distribution}
In short: simply send an e-mail to the recipient using Outlook, and
sign the message. If you created your own CA key pair instead of using
your browser to subscribe to a CA, then you must also attach the
\verb|ca.crt| file that you created.

Detailed explanation: You have a pair of keys (these were created in
\fullref{catable}).  One is a public key and the other is a private
key.  The public key must be sent to those who will send you encrypted
e-mail.  They will use your public key to encrypt messages to you.
Your public key is automatically contained in the signature of all
messages you sign.

So to distribute your public key, simply send the other party an
signed e-mail from Outlook.  Encrypting this key distribution message
is optional, but it must be signed.  They can then extract your public
key from your signature.

The \verb|ca.crt| also must be sent to your recipient if you created
one, because the application used by the recipient is unlikely to
accept certificates without a chain of trust.

\section{Prep to send encrypted mail% or verify signatures on received mail
}
Before you can send someone an encrypted message, you need the
recipients S/MIME certificate (public key).  This will normally come
to you when they send you a signed message, at which point you can
extract the certificate.  The certificate must then be associated to
that person in your address book.  Your Outlook Address Book has a
\emph{certificates} tab for each record, where you can verify and
control the association between that person and their certificate.

    \section{The S/MIME alternative: PGP}
    Pretty Good Privacy (``PGP'') is a public key infrastructure
    (``PKI'') just as S/MIME is, but it's more popular among
    individuals outside of the enterprise context.\\

    Outlook does not natively support PGP, so extra installations are
    required.  For OS/X and Windows there is a proprietary product
    from
    \href{https://www.symantec.com/products/desktop-email-encryption}{%
      Symantec}.  There is also a free software option for Windows
    users, where the typical PGP implementation is
    \href{https://www.gpg4win.org/version3.html}{GPG4Win}, which
    includes the MS Outlook plugin ``GPGOL''.  Historically Outlook
    has not worked well with PGP, but ``GPGOL'' has been overhauled in
    GPG4Win 3.0.  This
    \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TOUeTFUfgQ}{video} shows
    GPGOL in action (but note that that video shows the old version).\\

    This is a comparison between PGP and S/MIME on Outlook:\\[1em]
